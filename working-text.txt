Issue: Repository blocked from downloading
If download of repository is blocked due to any restrictions, please see the below work arounds in order of convenience:

1.	Upload framework to GitHub and transfer to client machine
2.	Zip-up framework and upload to a shared drive for download
3.	Copy files to notepad and email to client
Please note that if the workarounds are used manual updates will need to be taken from the central repository. If framework is not routinely kept up to date, the practice may not be able to continue supporting the framework.
