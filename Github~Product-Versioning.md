# **Product Versioning**
* We will be following the below versioning strategy for our projects.
* **Important**
* * <Major>.<Minor>.<Patch> e.g 1.0.0 (meaning 1st Major release with no minor
updates or patches/fixes.
* * Every time, a major integration is added, update the major version number and
push.
* * Every time you add a significant change or added new capability, update the
minor version number and push.
* * For every change pushed to master after a release let us update the patch
number.
* What constitutes a release? – We will have 2 releases per year. Once every 2 quarters.
If we have substantial changes, we will update to a new release version and
communicate to all forks to update to the latest release
* All code will be required to be merged to the trunk-master on a monthly basis.
Reminder emails for these merges as well as any other necessary merges that come up
will be sent in advance and a calendar of these planned merges will be hosted on
SharePoint here:

* The initial move to GitHub and new code management strategy will take some effort
and cooperation on all our parts at the beginning, but should improve both the rate at
which we are able to internally develop new tools and the stability of our product
teams’ engagement branches moving forward
