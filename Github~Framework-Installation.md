# **Installing your project**
* If you are unfamiliar with Git and have not used GitHub before, you can review the GitHub
user guides here: https://guides.github.com/
* GitHub can be leveraged in multiple ways, two of the most convenient of which are GitHub
desktop and IntelliJ’s Git integration
* GitHub desktop is a desktop application created by GitHub that allows the user to exercise
all Git operations through a very user friendly and easy to learn UI
* To install GitHub Desktop for free simply download the application here:
https://desktop.github.com/
*  **IMPORTANT NOTE:** if you previously had GitHub Desktop set up before setting up
two factor authentication you will need to log out of GitHub Desktop File/Settings/Sign
Out then log back in and it’ll prompt you for 2FA, after you verify your 2FA credentials you
will then be able to clone EY repositories
* A comprehensive guide on how to use GitHub desktop can be found here:
https://help.github.com/en/desktop
* If you would like to instead use IntelliJ’s built in Git capability to manage the installation of
your repository, you can open IntelliJ and download your project directly to your IDE by
selecting file/new/project from version control/git
* Copy and paste the clone URL from the GitHub project’s web page to your IntelliJ clone
window 
* After hitting clone be sure to click on the “Log in with Github” button as shown in below
picture (otherwise download will fail as no two-factor authentication can be done from the
first log in page)
* It is recommended that no matter how you choose to download your repository (GitHub
Desktop, IntelliJ integration, or simply downloading from GitHub) that you connect your
repository to GitHub Desktop to take advantage of the UI when merging. You can add any
downloaded GitHub project stored on your computer to GitHub Desktop by clicking file/add
a local repository and then pathing to that repository’s location on your computer
Important
* All users of NGeTAF must have knowledge of GitHub before being granted a license.
Learning to use GitHub desktop and the IntelliJ GitHub plugin are imperative to keeping
NGeTAF conflict free and Test I&A associates are highly encouraged to familiarize
themselves with both tools
