# Third-Party Integrations
NGTP is built modularly and it can support a whole lit of java libraries. If its a java library, it works with NGTP. If the library is hosted in a Central repository like maven you can simply copy/paste its dependency in the pom.xml under `<dependencies></dependencies>`


## Test Containerization
NGTP supports Docker/Kubernetes based test containerization and distributed parallel execution. [Here](zalenium-integration) is how you will do it.

## Azure DevOps
NGTP can be deployed to Azure Devops as easily as it can be pushed to a GitHub repository. [Here](azure-integration) is how you will do it.

## Report Portal
Report portal is an AI powered Test Automation Dashboard. It can:
* One-place dashboard
* Analyze results
* Live-streaming of results
* Defect traceability and automated issue-bucketing
* Visualization

[Here](report-portal-integration) is how you will do it.
