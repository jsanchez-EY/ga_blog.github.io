# **Setting up CI Pipelines**
Every library must have a `.github/workflows` package with predefined workflows for PR merge request and Release process. Reach out to the Build & Implementation team to get the workflows. This will be run automatically in GitHub actions everytime you push a code to a branch or merge a code with the master, automatically releasing a new version of the project
